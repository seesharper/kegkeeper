# KegKeeper 

"KegKeeper" is really just a silly name for a DIY digital scale that we can build relatively cheap and integrate with third-party applications like Home Assistant, Bar Helper or any applications that offers an API where we can push the current weight of our kegs. 

If you fancy this project and would like to support this and future projects I would really appreciate a cup of coffee 😃

## How to build

I've made a video that shows how to build, wire up and configure KegKeeper so that it can be integrated with Bar Helper. The video is in Norwegian, but should provide enough information to build the scale even for non-Norwegians 👍😃🇳🇴. The dialect I'm speaking is "Trøndersk" so don't worry if you don't understand a thing. Many Norwegians don't understand it either 😃.

## Parts list

In addition to this we need some [brackets](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2624188/files) to hold the load cells in place. If we don't have access to a 3D-printer, there are plenty of websites that offers printing. For instance [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/)
